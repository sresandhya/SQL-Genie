🚀 **LangChain with SQL Integration**

🔍 **Overview**
This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate LangChain, a powerful framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs), with SQL databases. It enables natural language querying of structured data by converting user prompts into SQL queries, executing them, and returning clear, meaningful results.
Perfect for building AI-powered chatbots, data explorers, or intelligent assistants that understand your queries and interact with real databases — no SQL knowledge required! 🎉

✨ **Features**
🗄️ Connect to popular SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite
🧠 Convert natural language inputs into precise SQL queries using LangChain
⚡ Execute queries on your database and fetch live data
📊 Return user-friendly, formatted results
🔧 Easily extendable and customizable for your unique use cases

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
🐍 Python
🤖 LangChain
🛢️ SQLAlchemy (for robust database connectivity)
💾 SQL databases (MySQL)
🔐 Environment variables for secure configuration
